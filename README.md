# Office pranks with Arduino / Teensy

My team mates know that I will use almost every opportunity to remind them
that leaving your computer unlocked when I'm around is not the best idea. Most
of the time I try to perform some harmless prank like reconfiguring the screen
to be rotated by 90 degrees or set embarassing wallpaper. It happened many
times but they never learn ...

But if they see me near their keyboard, they run in panic! Given that my daily
job is developing automation software I was wondering if there is any way to
speed up or even fully automate process of getting your collagues embarassed.

I present you with Teensy Pranker. The idea is simple - your victim forgets to
lock the computer, you plug in earlier prepared
[teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/)  microcontroller into their USB port
and within just few seconds wallpaper will be changed to very nice picture of
[pink pony](http://i.imgur.com/ZHNScON.png). This particular version works
with standard OSX, but the code is really easy and can be modified for
anything else.

DISCLAIMER: I was joking, don't use it on anyone's computer. Just your own.
Playing with someone elses computer without their consent can get you in
serious trouble.
